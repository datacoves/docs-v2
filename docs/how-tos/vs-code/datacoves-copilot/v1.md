### Step 1: Create a Datacoves Secret

- **Description:** Provide a simple description such as: `Open AI config`
- **Format:** Select `Raw JSON`
- **Value**: The value will vary based on the LLM you are utilizing.
  - **Open AI:** You only need your API key. Head to [Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create your key. `{"OPENAI_API_KEY": "Your key here"}`
  - **Azure Open AI:** This requires two credentials. Head to [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) to find your credentials under the [Deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/working-with-models?tabs=powershell#model-deployment-upgrade-configuration) tab. `{"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "Your endpoint here", "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"  : "Your key here"}`
- **Scope:** Select the desired scope, either `Project` or `Environment`.
- **Project/Environment:** Select the `Project` or `Environment` that will access this LLM.

Lastly, be sure to toggle on the `Share with developers` option so that users with developer access will be able to use the LLM.

## Working with an LLM in Datacoves Copilot v1

Once you have configured your LLM, working with the AI chat is a breeze!

## Pre-configured presets

While there are many use cases for AI in the development workflow there are a couple of tasks that come up regularly. To improve the user experience, we have created some presets that provide the LLM with specific instructions to get the best result. Use these or configure your own custom presets.

Current out of the box presents include:

- **Document dbt model:** Will provide descriptions for yml file you have open and provided as context.
- **Explain dbt model:** Will explain a dbt model file you have open and provided as context.
- **Explain dbt macro:** Will explain a dbt macro file you have open and provided as context.
- **Add descriptions to CSV:** Will provide descriptions for CSV files you have open and provided as context.

## How to use the Chat/Presets

### Extension UI/UX

To use your LLM head to the Datacoves Power User extension and open up `Copilot`.

### Provide files for context

The most important thing to remember is providing context to the LLM. In order to do this simply open up the file you wish to work with.
