#### OpenAI Compatible

## OpenAI Compatible LLM Providers

Datacoves Copilot supports a wide range of AI model providers that offer APIs compatible with the OpenAI API standard. This means you can use models from providers other than OpenAI, while still using a familiar API interface. This includes providers like:

- Local models running through tools like Ollama and LM Studio (covered in separate sections).
- Cloud providers like Azure, Perplexity, Together AI, Anyscale, and others.
- Any other provider offering an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

### Secret value format

```json
{
  "default": {
    "reasoningEffort": "medium",
    "openAiBaseUrl": "<BASE URL>",
    "openAiApiKey": "<YOUR API KEY>",

    "openAiUseAzure": false,
    "azureApiVersion": "",
    "openAiHeaders": {},
    "apiProvider": "openai",
    "id": "default"
  }
}
```

Where:

1. `openAiBaseUrl`: This is the API endpoint for the provider. It will not be https://api.openai.com/v1 (that's for the official OpenAI API).
2. `openAiApiKey`: This is the secret key you obtain from the provider.
3. `openAiModelId`: This is the model name of the specific model, each provider will expose a different set of models, please check provider's documentation.

If you're using `Azure`, please set `"openAiUseAzure": true`, optionally you could specify a specific API version using `"azureApiVersion": "<VERSION>"`.

#### Fine tune model usage
