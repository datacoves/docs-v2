# How to Configure your VS Code in the Datacoves Transform tab

When you first log into Datacoves, you will see that VS Code is disabled.

We need to connect to your git repository and to your data warehouse and configure your dbt profiles.yml. To do this, you need to update your user settings.

## Open Your User Settings

At the top right corner of the page, click the User icon and select _Settings_

![User Settings](./assets/menu_user_settings.gif)

## Setup git connection credentials

On the settings page scroll down to the Git SSH keys section.

![Git Settings](./assets/user_settings_git.png)

Click the Add drop down and select whether you want to provide an existing private key or have Datacoves auto generate one for you.

![Git Settings Add](./assets/user_settings_git2.png)

Datacoves will generate and display the corresponding public key, you will need to configure the public key for your git provider.

![Git Settings Public Key](./assets/user_settings_git3.png)

Click the _Copy_ button and follow the instructions to configure the public key for your git server.

Once your public SSH key has been added to your git server, test your connection.

If Datacoves is able to connect to your Git repository, you will see _Tested_ next to the repository url.

  <summary><strong>Snowflake Setup Instructions</strong></summary>

  # Snowflake Setup
  
  ## Setup Snowflake with Key Pair
  
  When connecting to Snowflake, you can use either key based authentication or username/password authentication.
  
  :::note
  To enable key-pair authentication, you admin must select `Inferred from user info using a custom template` when setting up the [Connection Template](/how-tos/datacoves/how_to_connection_template.md). The Snowflake username must match the username associated with the email used to authenticate with Datacoves for example `some_user` would be the snowflake username for `some_user@example.com`, please let us know if your username is different.
  :::
  
  If using key based authentication, you will need to provide or generate a key which will need to be added to Snowflake manually or contact us for information on how to automate this integration with Snowflake.
  
  Provide or automatically generate your keys. Then add the public key to Snowflake.
  
  ![Snowflake Settings Generate Keys](./assets/user_settings_snowflake.png)
  
  ## Assign the public key to the Snowflake User
  
  ```
  alter user <username> set rsa_public_key='<public key>';
  ```
  
  More information can be found in the [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#step-4-assign-the-public-key-to-a-snowflake-user)
  
  ## Complete the connection
  
  In the Database Connection Section, click `Add`
  
  ![Snowflake Setup Connection](./assets/user_settings_snowflake2.png)
  
  Give the connection a name. 
  
  :::tip
  This will be used as your dbt target name and is typically `dev`. 
  :::
  
  Next select a connection template. A connection template will have defaults pre-configured by your administrator.
  
  ![Snowflake Setup Connection Details](./assets/user_settings_snowflake3.png)
  
  ## Fill in connection details
  
  Datacoves will test the connection and display `Tested` next to the connection if successful. 
  
  :::note
  You can create additional dbt targets as shown below. This will allow you to execute dbt commands passing a specific target such as `dbt run my_model -t prd`
  :::

  ### Key Pair 
  
  If using key pair, you will need to change the auth method to key-pair.
  
  ![Select Auth](./assets/connection_select_auth.png)
  
  Select the drop down and your key you configured earlier should populate.
