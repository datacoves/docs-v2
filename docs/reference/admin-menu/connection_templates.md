## Overview

A Connection Template in Datacoves defines the basic information for your data warehouse. It acts as a template that can then be used for user and service connections. This simplifies the onboarding process for users.

On the Connection Templates landing page you can see a list of Connection Templates associated with each of your Datacoves projects.

For each template we can see the provider (i.e. Snowflake, Redshift) and the number of service and user accounts associated with each template.

Each row contains 2 action buttons, Edit and Delete.
